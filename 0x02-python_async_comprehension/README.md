# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

## Tasks
### 0. Async Generator
- Write a coroutine called async_generator that takes no arguments.

### 1. Async Comprehensions
- Import async_generator from the previous task and then write a coroutine called async_comprehension that takes no arguments.

### 2. Run time for four parallel comprehensions
- Import async_comprehension from the previous file and write a measure_runtime coroutine that will execute async_comprehension four times in parallel using asyncio.gather.
